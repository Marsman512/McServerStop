# McServerStop

A mod/plugin to stop a Fabric Minecraft server when the last player leaves.

After you run the server with this mod for the first time, there will
be a config file under `config/mc-server-stop/config.json`. So far
the only setting is the delay after which to stop the server, but
more could be added in the future.
